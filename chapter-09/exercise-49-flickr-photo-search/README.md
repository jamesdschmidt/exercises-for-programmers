# Exercise 49 Flickr Photo Search

A program that searches Flickr.
Exercise 49 Grabbing the Weather, Exercises for Programmers by Brian Hogan

Admittedly I got carried away with this one having prior experience in AWT, Swing, Win32, .NET, and iOS. The search is run on a background thread. The images load on background threads by convience APIs.

## How to compile

```bash
./flickr-photo-search$ mvn package
```

## How to run

```bash
./flickr-photo-search$ java -jar target/flickr-photo-search-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar <appid>
```
