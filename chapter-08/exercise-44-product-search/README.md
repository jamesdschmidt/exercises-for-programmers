# Exercise 44 Product Search

This exercise calls for dependencies so I reached for Maven. I tried putting off project complexity as long as possible.

## How to compile

```bash
./ProductSearch$ mvn package
```

## How to run

```bash
./ProductSearch$ java -jar target/ProductSearch-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
