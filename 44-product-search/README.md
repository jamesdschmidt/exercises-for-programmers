# Exercise 44 Product Search

This exercise calls for dependencies so I reached for Maven. I tried putting off project complexity as long as possible.

## How to compile

```bash
$ mvn package
```

## How to run

```bash
$ java -jar target/product-search-1.0.0.jar
```

## Example Output

```bash
What is the product name? Widget
Name: Widget
Price: $25.00
Quantity: 5
```
